### Test Scenarios for the `add` Method

---

**Scenario 1: Basic Addition Test**

Details:  
TestName: basicAddition  
Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the add method by adding two positive integers. It verifies whether the method correctly computes the sum of two numbers.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Define two integer variables with positive values.  
Act: Call the add method with these two integers as parameters.  
Assert: Verify that the returned result matches the expected sum of the two integers.  
Validation:  
The assertion ensures that the method accurately adds two positive integers. This is crucial for ensuring the calculator's reliability in basic arithmetic operations.

---

**Scenario 2: Addition With Negative Numbers**

Details:  
TestName: additionWithNegativeNumbers  
Description: This test verifies the method's ability to handle and correctly add negative numbers.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Define two integer variables where at least one or both are negative.  
Act: Call the add method with these integers.  
Assert: Check that the result matches the expected outcome when adding these numbers.  
Validation:  
This test confirms that the add method can accurately process negative numbers, which is essential for comprehensive arithmetic functionality in diverse scenarios.

---

**Scenario 3: Addition With Zero**

Details:  
TestName: additionWithZero  
Description: Tests the addition of zero to another number to confirm that adding zero leaves the original number unchanged.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Define an integer variable and another integer set to zero.  
Act: Invoke the add method with these two integers.  
Assert: Confirm that the result equals the non-zero integer.  
Validation:  
This test is significant as it validates the identity property of addition (adding zero to a number yields that number), which is a fundamental arithmetic rule.

---

**Scenario 4: Addition Resulting in Overflow**

Details:  
TestName: additionResultingInOverflow  
Description: This scenario tests the add method's behavior when the sum of two large integers results in an integer overflow.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Define two large integer values that, when added, exceed the maximum value for integers.  
Act: Call the add method with these values.  
Assert: Check that the result is as expected when integer overflow occurs (typically a negative number due to overflow in Java).  
Validation:  
This test checks for the method's handling of integer overflow, an important aspect for robustness in mathematical computations involving large numbers.

---

**Scenario 5: Addition of Maximum Integers**

Details:  
TestName: additionOfMaximumIntegers  
Description: Tests the addition of the maximum integer value with itself to observe the behavior under extreme conditions.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Set two variables to Integer.MAX_VALUE.  
Act: Invoke the add method with these values.  
Assert: Verify the result, expecting an overflow condition.  
Validation:  
This test is crucial for understanding how the add method manages scenarios involving the largest possible integers, which can be common in high-range computations.

---

These scenarios cover a range of typical and edge cases, ensuring the add method's functionality is thoroughly tested across different numerical conditions.
