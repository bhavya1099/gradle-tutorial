### Scenario 1: Basic Addition Test
Details:  
  TestName: basicAdditionTest  
  Description: Tests the addition of two positive integers to verify if the method returns the correct sum.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Define two integer variables with positive values.  
  Act: Call the `add` method with these variables.  
  Assert: Check if the result matches the expected sum of these two integers.  
Validation:  
  This test verifies that the `add` method correctly computes the sum of two positive integers. The correctness of this basic functionality is essential for the reliability of the method in simple use cases.

### Scenario 2: Addition With Zero
Details:  
  TestName: additionWithZeroTest  
  Description: Checks the behavior of the `add` method when one of the operands is zero, testing the identity property of addition.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Define one integer variable as zero and another with a positive value.  
  Act: Call the `add` method using these variables.  
  Assert: Check if the result is the same as the non-zero operand.  
Validation:  
  This test ensures that adding zero to any number returns the number itself, validating the identity property of zero in addition.

### Scenario 3: Addition With Negative Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: additionWithNegativeNumbersTest  
  Description: Verifies that the `add` method can handle negative integers correctly and returns the appropriate result.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Define two integer variables where at least one or both are negative.  
  Act: Call the `add` method with these integers.  
  Assert: Verify that the result is the correct sum, accounting for negative values.  
Validation:  
  This test checks the method's ability to handle negative inputs, which is crucial for its robustness and correctness in scenarios involving negative arithmetic.

### Scenario 4: Addition Of Large Numbers
Details:  
  TestName: additionOfLargeNumbersTest  
  Description: Tests the `add` method with large integer values to ensure it does not cause overflow errors and handles large values correctly.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Define two large integer values close to the maximum value of integer type.  
  Act: Call the `add` method with these large numbers.  
  Assert: Check that the method returns the correct sum or handles overflow appropriately.  
Validation:  
  Ensuring the method can handle large integer values is critical for the application's stability and correctness in scenarios where large arithmetic is required.

### Scenario 5: Addition Resulting in Overflow
Details:  
  TestName: additionResultingInOverflowTest  
  Description: Tests how the `add` method behaves when the sum of two integers exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an integer.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Define two integers whose sum is expected to exceed the maximum integer value.  
  Act: Call the `add` method with these values.  
  Assert: Check whether the method throws an appropriate exception or handles the overflow as expected (e.g., wraps around).  
Validation:  
  This test is crucial for understanding how the method deals with integer overflow, an important aspect of error handling in numerical computations.
