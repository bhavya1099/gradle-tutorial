Scenario 1: Test addition of two positive numbers

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test checks if the add method correctly adds two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive integers, a = 5 and b = 3.
  Act: Call the add method with these integers.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the add method is 8.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test validates that the basic arithmetic addition operation is implemented correctly. The significance is ensuring that the method handles standard positive integer addition as expected.

Scenario 2: Test addition of two negative numbers

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test verifies that the add method can correctly add two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative integers, a = -5 and b = -3.
  Act: Call the add method with these integers.
  Assert: Assert that the result is -8.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly handles addition where both operands are negative, which is crucial for correct arithmetic operations across different number ranges.

Scenario 3: Test addition of a positive and a negative number

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegativeNumber
  Description: This test checks if the add method correctly adds a positive integer and a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive integer a = 5 and a negative integer b = -3.
  Act: Call the add method with these integers.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 2.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the add method can handle cases where one operand is positive and the other is negative, ensuring accurate computation in mixed-sign scenarios.

Scenario 4: Test addition resulting in zero

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionResultingInZero
  Description: This test verifies that the add method correctly adds two numbers that result in zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two integers, a = 3 and b = -3.
  Act: Call the add method with these integers.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the add method can correctly compute zero, which is a special case in addition, ensuring the method's reliability with neutral outcomes.

Scenario 5: Test addition with zero

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: This test checks if the add method treats zero as a neutral element in addition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two integers, a = 0 and b = 5.
  Act: Call the add method with these integers.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 5.
Validation:
  This test confirms that adding zero to any number does not change the number, which is a fundamental property of zero in addition. Ensuring this behavior is correctly implemented is crucial for the reliability of numerical calculations.

Scenario 6: Test addition of maximum integer values

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfMaxIntValues
  Description: This test checks if the add method correctly handles the overflow scenario when adding two maximum integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two integers, a = Integer.MAX_VALUE and b = Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  Act: Call the add method with these integers.
  Assert: Assert that the result is -2 (due to integer overflow).
Validation:
  This test checks for integer overflow, which is critical for understanding and handling potential exceptions or errors in high-value computations. It confirms the method's behavior under extreme conditions, ensuring robustness.
