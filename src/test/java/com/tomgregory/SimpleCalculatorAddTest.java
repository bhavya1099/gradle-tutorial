### Test Scenarios for the `add` Method

---

**Scenario 1: Basic Addition Test**

Details:  
TestName: basicAdditionTest  
Description: Test the add method with two positive integers to verify if it correctly computes the sum.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Define two integer variables, `a = 5` and `b = 3`.  
Act: Call `add(a, b)` and capture the result.  
Assert: Assert that the result is `8`.  
Validation:  
The assertion checks if the method correctly adds two positive numbers. This confirms the method's basic arithmetic correctness and its ability to handle typical use cases.

---

**Scenario 2: Zero Addition Test**

Details:  
TestName: zeroAdditionTest  
Description: Test the add method with one of the integers as zero to ensure the method returns the other integer as the sum, which validates handling of zero.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Define two integer variables, `a = 0` and `b = 7`.  
Act: Call `add(a, b)` and capture the result.  
Assert: Assert that the result is `7`.  
Validation:  
This test confirms that adding zero to any number returns the number itself, which is a fundamental property of addition.

---

**Scenario 3: Negative Numbers Addition Test**

Details:  
TestName: negativeNumbersAdditionTest  
Description: Test the add method with two negative integers to verify correct computation of their sum.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Define two integer variables, `a = -4` and `b = -6`.  
Act: Call `add(a, b)` and capture the result.  
Assert: Assert that the result is `-10`.  
Validation:  
This test checks if the method can accurately handle the addition of negative numbers, confirming its effectiveness across the integer range.

---

**Scenario 4: Mixed Sign Numbers Addition Test**

Details:  
TestName: mixedSignNumbersAdditionTest  
Description: Test the addition of one positive and one negative integer to ensure the method correctly computes the sum.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Define two integer variables, `a = -5` and `b = 10`.  
Act: Call `add(a, b)` and capture the result.  
Assert: Assert that the result is `5`.  
Validation:  
This scenario validates that the method correctly computes the sum of numbers with mixed signs, which is crucial for accurate arithmetic operations in real-world applications.

---

**Scenario 5: Large Numbers Addition Test**

Details:  
TestName: largeNumbersAdditionTest  
Description: Test the add method with two very large integers to ensure it handles integer overflow correctly.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Define two integer variables, `a = Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `b = 1`.  
Act: Call `add(a, b)` and capture the result.  
Assert: Assert that the result is `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.  
Validation:  
This test checks the method's behavior when the sum exceeds the range of int type, confirming its handling of overflow conditions.

---

**Scenario 6: Symmetric Property Test**

Details:  
TestName: symmetricPropertyTest  
Description: Test the add method to check if the order of parameters affects the sum, ensuring the symmetric property of addition (a+b = b+a).  
Execution:  
Arrange: Define two integer variables, `a = 12` and `b = 15`.  
Act: Call `add(a, b)` and `add(b, a)`, then capture both results.  
Assert: Assert that both results are equal and correct.  
Validation:  
This test confirms that the addition operation is commutative, a fundamental property of addition, ensuring that the method's implementation does not depend on the order of operands.

---

These scenarios cover a range of typical, boundary, and special cases, ensuring comprehensive testing of the `add` method functionality.
