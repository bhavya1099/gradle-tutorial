Scenario 1: Test addition of two positive numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the add method when both input parameters are positive integers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to setup any data as this is a simple addition operation. 
  Act: Invoke the add method with two positive integers. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the add method correctly adds two positive integers. The expected result is based on the standard mathematical addition operation. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the add method.

Scenario 2: Test addition of two negative numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the add method when both input parameters are negative integers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to setup any data as this is a simple addition operation. 
  Act: Invoke the add method with two negative integers. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the add method correctly adds two negative integers. The expected result is based on the standard mathematical addition operation. This test is significant as it ensures the add method works correctly with negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test addition of a positive number and a negative number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveAndNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the add method when one input parameter is positive and the other is negative. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to setup any data as this is a simple addition operation. 
  Act: Invoke the add method with one positive integer and one negative integer. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the add method correctly adds a positive and a negative integer. The expected result is based on the standard mathematical addition operation. This test is significant as it ensures the add method works correctly when the inputs have different signs.

Scenario 4: Test addition of zero and a number

Details:  
  TestName: testAdditionOfZeroAndNumber
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the add method when one input parameter is zero and the other is an integer. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to setup any data as this is a simple addition operation. 
  Act: Invoke the add method with zero and an integer. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the add method correctly adds zero and an integer. The expected result is the integer itself. This test is significant as it validates the add method's handling of zero.
