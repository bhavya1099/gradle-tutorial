"""
  Scenario 1: Positive numbers addition

  Details:  
    TestName: testAddPositiveNumbers.
    Description: This test is meant to validate the addition operation when both a and b parameters are positive numbers. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required as inputs are directly passed as parameters.
    Act: Invoke add method with two positive numbers. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result.
  Validation: 
    Validates that the addition operation returns the correct summation result for positive numbers. This test demonstrates the basic functionality of the code.
  

  Scenario 2: Negative numbers addition

  Details:  
    TestName: testAddNegativeNumbers.
    Description: This test is meant to check the addition operation when both a and b parameters are negative numbers. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required as inputs are directly passed as parameters.
    Act: Invoke add method with two negative numbers.  
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result.
  Validation: 
    Validates that the addition operation returns the correct summation result for negative numbers. It ensures the method can handle and return the correct result for negative number addition.


  Scenario 3: Zero value addition 

  Details:  
    TestName: testAddZeroValue.
    Description: This test is meant to validate the addition operation when either of the parameters (a or b) or both have a value of zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement necessary as inputs are directly passed as parameters.
    Act: Invoke add method with a zero value and a non-zero value.   
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result.
  Validation: 
    Validates that the addition operation returns the correct summation result when one or both parameters are zero.


  Scenario 4: Maximum integer values addition
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testAddMaxValues.
    Description: This test is meant to check the addition operation when both the addends are maximum possible integer value supported by Java. Here it aims to verify Integer Overflow case.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement needed as inputs are directly passed as parameters.
    Act: Invoke add method with two maximum positive integer values.  
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result.
  Validation: 
    Validates that the addition of maximum integers results in Integer Overflow, thus, becoming negative. This shows how the method handles an overflow condition.

  Scenario 5: Mix of positive and negative numbers of addition

  Details:  
    TestName: testAddMixNumbers.
    Description: This test is intended to evaluate the addition operation when one addend is positive and the other is negative. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement necessary as inputs are directly passed as parameters.
    Act: Invoke add method with a positive and negative number.  
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result.
  Validation: 
    Validates that the method correctly applies arithmetic rules to get the correct sum when dealing with a mix of positive and negative numbers.
