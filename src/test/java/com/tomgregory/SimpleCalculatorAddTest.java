### Scenario 1: Basic Addition Test
Details:  
  TestName: basicAdditionTest  
  Description: Tests the addition of two positive integers to verify if the method returns the correct sum.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Define two integer variables with positive values.  
  Act: Call the `add` method with these variables.  
  Assert: Check if the result matches the expected sum of these two integers.  
Validation:  
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two positive numbers. The expected result is significant as it ensures the basic arithmetic operation of addition is implemented correctly in the application.

### Scenario 2: Addition With Zero
Details:  
  TestName: additionWithZeroTest  
  Description: Tests the addition of a number and zero to verify if the method treats zero as the neutral element in addition.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Define one integer variable with a non-zero value and another with zero.  
  Act: Call the `add` method with these variables.  
  Assert: Check if the result equals the non-zero integer.  
Validation:  
  This test confirms that adding zero to any number returns the original number, which is fundamental for correct arithmetic operations within the application.

### Scenario 3: Negative Numbers Addition
Details:  
  TestName: negativeNumbersAdditionTest  
  Description: Tests the addition of two negative integers to verify if the method correctly calculates their sum.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Define two negative integer variables.  
  Act: Call the `add` method with these variables.  
  Assert: Check if the result is the correct sum, which should also be negative.  
Validation:  
  The test ensures that the addition method accurately handles negative numbers, which is crucial for applications dealing with a range of integer inputs.

### Scenario 4: Mixed Sign Numbers Addition
Details:  
  TestName: mixedSignNumbersAdditionTest  
  Description: Tests the addition of one positive and one negative integer to check if the method correctly computes their sum.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Define one positive and one negative integer variable.  
  Act: Call the `add` method with these variables.  
  Assert: Check if the result is the algebraic sum of these two numbers.  
Validation:  
  This test is important to ensure that the addition method can handle integers of different signs and compute their sum correctly, reflecting true arithmetic behavior.

### Scenario 5: Large Numbers Addition
Details:  
  TestName: largeNumbersAdditionTest  
  Description: Tests the addition of two very large integers to verify if the method can handle large values without overflow.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Define two very large integer variables.  
  Act: Call the `add` method with these variables.  
  Assert: Check if the result is the correct sum or if an overflow is handled (if applicable).  
Validation:  
  Verifying the addition of large numbers is essential to confirm that the method can handle extreme values, which might be critical in high-value computations in the application.

### Scenario 6: Integer Overflow Test
Details:  
  TestName: integerOverflowTest  
  Description: Tests the addition of two integers where the sum exceeds the maximum value for integers to check how the method handles overflow.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Define two integers whose sum exceeds the maximum integer value.  
  Act: Call the `add` method with these variables.  
  Assert: Observe the behavior or result, checking for correct handling of overflow.  
Validation:  
  This test is crucial for understanding the behavior of the addition operation under overflow conditions, which can impact the reliability and correctness of arithmetic computations in the application.
