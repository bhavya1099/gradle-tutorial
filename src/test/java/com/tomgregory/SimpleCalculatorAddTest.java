"""
  Scenario 1: Test with two positive integers
  Details:  
    TestName: testAddWithPositiveIntegers
    Description: This test is meant to check the correct return value of add method when passed two positive integers. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data preparations or mocks required as input values are passed as arguments.
    Act: Invoke the method with two positive integers e.g., add(1, 2).
    Assert: Check that the return value is correct i.e., 3.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two positive integers. The expected result is based on the basic mathematical addition operation. 
    This test is significant because it confirms that the add method performs correctly for the most straightforward scenario.

  Scenario 2: Test with two negative integers
  Details:  
    TestName: testAddWithNegativeIntegers
    Description: This test is meant to check the correct return value of add method when passed two negative integers. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data preparations or mocks required as input values are passed as arguments.
    Act: Invoke the method with two negative integers e.g., add(-1, -2).
    Assert: Check that the return value is correct i.e., -3.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two negative integers. The expected result is based on the basic mathematical addition operation.
    This test confirms that the add method performs correctly when negative integers are passed.

  Scenario 3: Test with one positive and one negative integer
  Details:  
    TestName: testAddWithPositiveAndNegativeInteger
    Description: This test is meant to check the correct return value of add method when passed one positive and one negative integer. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data preparations or mocks required as input values are passed as arguments.
    Act: Invoke the method with a positive and a negative integer e.g., add(-1, 2).
    Assert: Check that the return value is correct i.e., 1.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly adds a positive and a negative integer. The expected result is based on the basic mathematical addition operation.
    This test confirms that the add method performs correctly under these conditions.

  Scenario 4: Test with zero 
  Details:  
    TestName: testAddWithZero
    Description: This test is meant to check the correct return value of add method when passed zero and a positive or negative integer. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data preparations or mocks required as input values are passed as arguments.
    Act: Invoke the method with zero and a positive or negative integer e.g., add(0, 1).
    Assert: Check that the return value is correct i.e., 1.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly adds zero and an integer. The expected result is the same integer as per basic mathematical addition operation..
    This test confirms the correct handling of zero in the addition operation.

  Scenario 5: Test with maximum integer values
  Details:  
    TestName: testAddWithMaxIntegers
    Description: This test is meant to check the correct return value of add method when passed MAX_INTEGER values. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data preparations or mocks required as input values are passed as arguments.
    Act: Invoke the method with maximum integer values e.g., add(MAX_INT, MAX_INT).
    Assert: Check that the return value wraps around the Integer limit.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles maximum integer values. The expected result is a negative integer, considering MAX_INT is 2147483647 and adding two of them results in overflow.
    This crucial test confirms that the code can handle integer overflow properly.
