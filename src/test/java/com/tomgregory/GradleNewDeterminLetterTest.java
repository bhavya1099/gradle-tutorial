Certainly! Below are various test scenarios for the `determinLetter` method:

``` 
Scenario 1: Test with a negative grade
Details:
  TestName: testNegativeGrade
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the determinLetter method when passed a negative number as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative grade value.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method using the negative grade.
  Assert: Expect the method to throw an IllegalArgumentException.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the IllegalArgumentException is thrown as expected for negative input values. This test is significant because it ensures that the method handles invalid input gracefully, adhering to the specified business rules.

Scenario 2: Test with a grade less than 60
Details:
  TestName: testGradeLessThan60
  Description: This test verifies that the method returns 'F' for grades less than 60.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a grade value less than 60.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method using this grade.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 'F'.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that grades under 60 correctly map to the letter grade 'F'. This is crucial for maintaining grading integrity and accuracy.

Scenario 3: Test with a grade between 60 and 68
Details:
  TestName: testGradeBetween60And68
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'D' for grades between 60 and 68 inclusive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a grade value between 60 and 68.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method using this grade.
  Assert: Ensure the returned value is 'D'.
Validation:
  This test confirms that grades in this range are properly classified as 'D', ensuring the grading system functions as expected for lower passing grades.

Scenario 4: Test with a grade between 69 and 79
Details:
  TestName: testGradeBetween69And79
  Description: This test verifies the return value of 'C' for grades between 69 and 79 inclusive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a grade value in this range.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 'C'.
Validation:
  By asserting the correct grade mapping, this test ensures that the grading methodology is consistently applied, critical for fair and systematic evaluation of student performance.

Scenario 5: Test with a grade of 80 or above
Details:
  TestName: testGrade80OrAbove
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'O' for grades of 80 or above.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a grade value of 80 or more.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method using this grade.
  Assert: Check if the returned letter is 'O'.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that high achievers are rewarded with the top letter grade 'O', pivotal for recognizing and motivating academic excellence.

Scenario 6: Test exactly at boundary 60
Details:
  TestName: testBoundaryAt60
  Description: Verify that the method returns 'D' when the grade is exactly 60.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade to exactly 60.
  Act: Call determinLetter with this grade.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is 'D'.
Validation:
  This test confirms boundary condition handling at the critical pass mark, ensuring the grading system is accurate and reliable at threshold values.
``` 

These scenarios collectively ensure comprehensive testing of the `determinLetter` method across its operational range, including boundary conditions and error handling.
