ROOST_METHOD_HASH=determinLetter_c52811fc05
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=determinLetter_c927558175

Scenario 1: Test with negative grade input

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNegativeGrade
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the determinLetter method when provided with a negative grade. The method should throw an IllegalArgumentException as negative grades are not valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative grade value.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with the negative grade.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles invalid input by throwing an exception, ensuring the method's robustness against incorrect data inputs.

Scenario 2: Test with zero as grade input

Details:  
  TestName: testWithZeroGrade
  Description: This test verifies the determinLetter method's output when the input grade is zero, which is the boundary condition for the 'F' grade category.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to zero.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Check that the returned grade letter is 'F'.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the method accurately assigns the 'F' grade to a score of zero, demonstrating the method's correct handling of boundary values.

Scenario 3: Test with grade just below 60

Details:  
  TestName: testWithGradeJustBelow60
  Description: This test checks the determinLetter method's response to a grade of 59, which is just below the threshold for a 'D' grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 59.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Ensure the returned grade letter is 'F'.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the method correctly categorizes a grade of 59 as 'F', validating the method's precision in grade categorization at boundary conditions.

Scenario 4: Test with grade at the lower boundary of D

Details:  
  TestName: testWithGradeAtLowerBoundaryOfD
  Description: This test examines how the determinLetter method categorizes a grade of 60, which is the exact lower boundary for a 'D' grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 60.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Verify that the returned grade letter is 'D'.
Validation: 
  This assertion ensures that the method correctly identifies the lower limit for 'D' grades, verifying accurate grade categorization.

Scenario 5: Test with highest possible grade

Details:  
  TestName: testWithHighestPossibleGrade
  Description: This test determines the behavior of the determinLetter method when given a very high grade, such as 100, which should logically fall within the highest grade category.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 100.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Check that the returned grade letter is 'O'.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the method assigns the highest letter grade 'O' for top scores, confirming the method's ability to handle upper extreme values correctly.

Scenario 6: Test with grade just below 80

Details:  
  TestName: testWithGradeJustBelow80
  Description: This test checks how the determinLetter method categorizes a grade of 79, which is just below the threshold for an 'O' grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 79.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Ensure the returned grade letter is 'C'.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly categorizes a grade of 79 as 'C', ensuring accurate categorization at critical boundaries.
