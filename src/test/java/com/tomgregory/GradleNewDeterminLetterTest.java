Scenario 1: Test for Negative Number Input

Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeNumberInput.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method throws IllegalArgumentException when the input is a negative number. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No need for setup as we are directly passing the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a negative number as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method handles negative numbers correctly by throwing an exception. This is important as grades cannot be negative.

Scenario 2: Test for Input Less than 60

Details:  
  TestName: testInputLessThanSixty.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns 'F' when the input is less than 60. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No need for setup as we are directly passing the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a number less than 60 as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if 'F' is returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly assigns the grade 'F' for scores less than 60. This is important to ensure grading is accurate.

Scenario 3: Test for Input Between 60 and 69

Details:  
  TestName: testInputBetweenSixtyAndSixtyNine.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns 'D' when the input is between 60 and 69. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No need for setup as we are directly passing the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a number between 60 and 69 as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if 'D' is returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly assigns the grade 'D' for scores between 60 and 69. This is important to ensure grading is accurate.

Scenario 4: Test for Input Between 70 and 79

Details:  
  TestName: testInputBetweenSeventyAndSeventyNine.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns 'C' when the input is between 70 and 79. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No need for setup as we are directly passing the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a number between 70 and 79 as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if 'C' is returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly assigns the grade 'C' for scores between 70 and 79. This is important to ensure grading is accurate.

Scenario 5: Test for Input Greater than 80

Details:  
  TestName: testInputGreaterThanEighty.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns 'O' when the input is greater than 80. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No need for setup as we are directly passing the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a number greater than 80 as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if 'O' is returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly assigns the grade 'O' for scores greater than 80. This is important to ensure grading is accurate.
