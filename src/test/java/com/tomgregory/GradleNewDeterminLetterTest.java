ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=determinLetter_c927558175

Scenario 1: Test with a negative grade input

Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeGradeInput
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the determinLetter method when passed a negative grade. The method should throw an IllegalArgumentException as negative grades are not valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative test input.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with the negative input.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles invalid input by throwing an exception, ensuring the method's robustness in face of erroneous data. It is significant as it prevents the method from processing invalid grades which could lead to incorrect letter grades being assigned.

Scenario 2: Test with a grade less than 60

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeLessThanSixty
  Description: Tests the determinLetter method to ensure it returns 'F' for grades less than 60.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a grade input of 59.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this input.
  Assert: Verify that the output is 'F'.
Validation: 
  This test checks that the method correctly categorizes grades less than 60 as 'F'. It's important for accurately reflecting academic performance in scenarios where failing grades need to be clearly identified.

Scenario 3: Test with a grade in the D range (60 to 68)

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeInDRange
  Description: Verifies that the determinLetter method returns 'D' for grades between 60 and 68 inclusive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a grade input of 65.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Check that the output is 'D'.
Validation: 
  This test ensures that the method correctly interprets grades in the 60-68 range as 'D'. It supports academic grading standards by properly categorizing near-failing but passing grades.

Scenario 4: Test with a grade in the C range (69 to 79)

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeInCRange
  Description: Tests that the determinLetter method returns 'C' for grades between 69 and 79 inclusive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a grade input of 75.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method.
  Assert: Assert that the output is 'C'.
Validation: 
  This scenario confirms that the method accurately assigns a 'C' to grades that are average, ensuring that the grading system is adhered to correctly.

Scenario 5: Test with a grade that is out of defined ranges (>= 80)

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeOutOfDefinedRanges
  Description: Ensures that the determinLetter method returns 'O' for grades 80 or above, checking for grades not explicitly covered by other conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a grade input of 85.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Verify that the returned grade is 'O'.
Validation: 
  This test checks that the method defaults to 'O' for high grades that surpass defined grading boundaries. It's crucial for handling exceptional academic performance and ensuring all grades are processed even if they don't fit typical categories.
