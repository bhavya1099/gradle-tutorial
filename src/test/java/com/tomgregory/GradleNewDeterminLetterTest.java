================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Logical Error in Code Flow
Issue: The code contains a redundant condition where grades less than 60 are checked twice, which might cause confusion and maintenance issues. No checks for grades above 80, potentially leading to incorrect grade assignment.
Solution: Remove the duplicate condition and ensure all possible grade values are accounted for in the logic. Add an else-if condition to handle grades between 80 and 100, and a final else to catch any values above 100.

Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The method does not handle non-integer inputs or extremely high integer values which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Solution: Implement additional checks to ensure the input is within a realistic range for grades (e.g., 0 to 100). Consider using specific data types or libraries that enforce this range.

Vulnerability: Exception Handling
Issue: The method throws a runtime exception for invalid input, which might not be caught or handled properly, leading to application crashes.
Solution: Use more specific exception types or create a custom exception class to handle invalid grade inputs more gracefully. Ensure exceptions are caught and handled appropriately in the calling code.

### Test Scenarios for the `determinLetter` Method

#### Scenario 1: Test with negative number input
Details:  
  TestName: testWithNegativeInput
  Description: This test checks if the method throws an IllegalArgumentException when a negative number is passed as input. This is important to ensure the method handles invalid inputs correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a negative number as input.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this negative input.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the method's ability to reject invalid input values, ensuring that the grading logic only processes valid, non-negative numbers.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in preventing the application from processing erroneous data that could lead to incorrect application behavior or crashes.

#### Scenario 2: Test with zero as input
Details:  
  TestName: testWithZeroInput
  Description: Tests the method's response to an input of zero, which is a boundary condition. The expected grade for zero is 'F'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide zero as the input.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with zero.
  Assert: Assert that the returned grade is 'F'.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks for correct grade categorization at the boundary of the grading scale.
  Elaborate on the role of this test in confirming that edge cases are handled correctly within the grading system.

#### Scenario 3: Test with input just below 60
Details:  
  TestName: testJustBelowSixty
  Description: Ensures that an input of 59 correctly returns a grade of 'F', testing the upper boundary of the 'F' grade range.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide 59 as the input.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this input.
  Assert: Assert that the returned grade is 'F'.
Validation:
  Clarify that this is to verify boundary accuracy for grade determination.
  Elaborate on ensuring accurate grading near critical thresholds, which is key for fairness and correctness in grading.

#### Scenario 4: Test with input in the middle of a valid range (e.g., 75 for 'C')
Details:  
  TestName: testMidRangeForC
  Description: Checks if an input of 75 correctly returns a grade of 'C', ensuring the method correctly handles typical valid inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide 75 as the input.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this input.
  Assert: Assert that the returned grade is 'C'.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion tests correct grade output for inputs within expected operational ranges.
  Elaborate on the importance of accurate grade output for standard inputs, crucial for user trust in the grading system.

#### Scenario 5: Test with very high input (above any specific grade boundary)
Details:  
  TestName: testHighInputAboveBoundaries
  Description: Tests how the method handles an input significantly higher than defined grade boundaries, such as 100.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide 100 as the input.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this input.
  Assert: Assert that the returned grade is 'O' (assuming 'O' represents an outstanding or overflow category).
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks for the method's handling of inputs that exceed typical grade boundaries.
  Elaborate on ensuring the method gracefully handles extraordinary input values, which might represent exceptional cases or errors in data entry.
