================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Logical Error in Condition Checks
Issue: The code contains a redundant condition check for 'numGrade < 60' which leads to unreachable code. This could cause unexpected behavior if the code is extended or modified.
Solution: Remove the redundant condition check to ensure all branches are reachable and logically correct. Review the logic to ensure it correctly implements the intended business rules.

Vulnerability: Error Handling - IllegalArgumentException
Issue: Throwing IllegalArgumentException without proper context or error handling might not be sufficient for callers to understand the reason for the exception, especially in larger applications.
Solution: Enhance exception handling by providing more detailed error messages or using custom exception types that can carry more context about the error condition.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with a negative grade input

Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeGradeInput
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the determinLetter method when provided with a negative grade, which should throw an IllegalArgumentException as per the method definition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer value representing a negative grade, e.g., -1.
  Act: Attempt to invoke the determinLetter method using the negative grade.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the method's compliance with its specification to throw IllegalArgumentException for grades less than 0, ensuring that the method handles invalid input correctly.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in preventing the method from processing invalid grade values, which could lead to incorrect application behavior.

Scenario 2: Test with a grade just below 60

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeJustBelow60
  Description: This test verifies that the determinLetter method returns 'F' for grades that are just below 60, specifically testing the boundary condition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an integer grade value of 59.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this grade value.
  Assert: Check that the returned character is 'F'.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the assertion checks the correct grade categorization according to the defined grade thresholds.
  Elaborate on why accurately testing boundary conditions is crucial for ensuring the method's reliability in grading assessments.

Scenario 3: Test with a grade in the 'D' range

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeInDRange
  Description: To ensure that the determinLetter method correctly identifies and returns 'D' for a grade between 60 and 68 inclusive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an integer grade value of 65.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns 'D'.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the test is aimed at confirming the method's ability to correctly categorize a valid 'D' grade.
  Elaborate on the importance of accurate grade categorization for proper academic evaluation and reporting.

Scenario 4: Test with a grade in the 'C' range

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeInCRange
  Description: To check if the determinLetter method accurately returns 'C' for grades between 69 and 79 inclusive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an integer grade value of 75.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Ensure that 'C' is the returned grade.
Validation: 
  Clarify that this assertion confirms correct grading within the specified range.
  Elaborate on the significance of precise grade categorization in academic settings for ensuring students receive appropriate feedback.

Scenario 5: Test with a grade above the highest defined threshold

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeAboveHighestThreshold
  Description: To test how the determinLetter method handles grades that exceed the highest defined threshold, which should return 'O' according to the current implementation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an integer grade value of 90.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned character is 'O'.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the test checks for the method's handling of exceptionally high grades, ensuring it defaults to 'O' when grades exceed the highest categorized threshold.
  Elaborate on how handling grades beyond defined categories is essential for maintaining robustness and flexibility in grade evaluation systems.
