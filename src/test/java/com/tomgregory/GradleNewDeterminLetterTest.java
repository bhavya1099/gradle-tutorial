"""
  Scenario 1: Determining letter grade for a negative number
  
  Details:   
    TestName: testNegativeNumberGrade.
    Description: The test is meant to check how the method behaves when passed a negative integer grade. Since grades cannot be negative, the method should throw an IllegalArgumentException.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data setup or mocks required.
    Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a negative integer parameter.
    Assert: JUnit assertions should validate that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to verify that the method correctly handles invalid input (negative grade) by throwing the expected IllegalArgumentException. This error handling is essential for maintaining data integrity.

  Scenario 2: Determining letter grade for a grade less than 60

  Details:
    TestName: testGradeLessThan60.
    Description: This test is meant to check the letter grade returned by the determinLetter method when the parameter numGrade is less than 60. The function should return 'F'. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data setup or mocks required.
    Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a number less than 60.
    Assert: JUnit assertions should validate that the method returns 'F'.
  Validation: 
    The test is validated by ensuring that the method correctly determines a 'F' letter grade for a grade less than 60. This behavior follows standard grading conventions.

  Scenario 3: Determining letter grade for a grade between 60 and 69

  Details:
    TestName: testGradeBetween60And69.
    Description: This test checks the functionality of the determinLetter method for grades between 60 and 69, inclusive. The expected letter grade is 'D'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data setup or mocks required.
    Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a number between 60 and 69.
    Assert: JUnit assertions should validate that the method returns 'D'.
  Validation: 
    The test ensures that the method correctly determines a 'D' letter grade for number grades between 60 and 69. This reflects standard grading conventions.

  Scenario 4: Determining letter grade for a grade between 70 and 79

  Details:
    TestName: testGradeBetween70And79.
    Description: The test checks that the determinLetter method correctly returns 'C' for grades between 70 and 79, inclusive.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data setup or mocks required.
    Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a number between 70 and 79.
    Assert: JUnit assertions should validate that the method returns 'C'.
  Validation: 
    The test verifies that the method correctly assigns a 'C' letter grade for number grades between 70 and 79, which adheres to standard grading conventions.

  Scenario 5: Determining letter grade for a grade 80 or above

  Details:
    TestName: testGrade80OrAbove.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the determinLetter method returns 'O' for numGrade equal to or greater than 80.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data setup or mocks required.
    Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a number equal to or greater than 80.
    Assert: JUnit assertions should validate that the method returns 'O'.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to ensure that the method correctly assigns a 'O' letter grade for number grades of 80 or above, which follows the methods grading conventions.
