================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Logical Error in Condition Checks
Issue: The code contains redundant condition checks for 'numGrade < 60', which can lead to unreachable code and incorrect behavior if the code is extended or modified incorrectly.
Solution: Remove the redundant condition check to ensure each grade range is uniquely handled and there is no unreachable code. Make sure all conditions are mutually exclusive and cover all possible input ranges.

Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The method throws an IllegalArgumentException for negative values but does not handle other types of bad input such as excessively large numbers which might cause unexpected behavior in the broader application context.
Solution: Enhance input validation to handle all edge cases including excessively high numbers. Consider defining a maximum valid grade and check for this in your conditions.

Vulnerability: Exception Handling
Issue: The method uses runtime exceptions to handle input errors. While this is not inherently insecure, it could lead to poor user experiences or denial of service if not properly managed.
Solution: Consider using custom checked exceptions or error handling strategies that do not disrupt the normal operation of the application. Ensure exceptions are caught and handled gracefully where this method is used.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with negative grade input

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNegativeGrade
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the determinLetter method when provided with a negative grade. The method should throw an IllegalArgumentException as negative grades are not valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative integer value for the grade.
  Act: Attempt to invoke the determinLetter method with this negative grade.
  Assert: Capture the IllegalArgumentException and verify that it is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the method throws an IllegalArgumentException for negative inputs, which verifies the method's ability to handle invalid input correctly. This is significant as it prevents the method from processing illogical values that could lead to undefined behavior.

Scenario 2: Test with zero as the grade

Details:  
  TestName: testWithZeroGrade
  Description: Tests the determinLetter method with a grade of 0, which is the boundary condition for failing grades.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 0.
  Act: Call determinLetter with the grade of 0.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 'F'.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly identifies 0 as a failing grade. It's crucial for ensuring that boundary conditions are handled appropriately.

Scenario 3: Test with the lowest passing grade

Details:  
  TestName: testLowestPassingGrade
  Description: This test ensures that the determinLetter method correctly identifies the lowest passing grade (60) and assigns a 'D'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 60.
  Act: Call determinLetter with the grade.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 'D'.
Validation: 
  This test confirms that the method correctly assigns a 'D' for a grade of 60, which is important for accurate grade representation.

Scenario 4: Test with a grade in the 'C' range

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeInCRange
  Description: Verifies that the determinLetter method assigns a 'C' for grades that fall within the 'C' range (70-79).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 75.
  Act: Call determinLetter with the grade.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 'C'.
Validation: 
  Ensures that the method accurately categorizes and returns the correct letter grade for mid-range scores, which is vital for consistent grading standards.

Scenario 5: Test with a grade above the defined thresholds

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeAboveThresholds
  Description: Checks the determinLetter method's response to a grade higher than any defined threshold, expecting an 'O'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 90.
  Act: Call determinLetter with the grade.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 'O'.
Validation: 
  This test validates that the method correctly handles grades that exceed the highest defined grade category, ensuring that exceptional performances are recognized appropriately.

Scenario 6: Test with grade exactly at 69

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeAtSixtyNine
  Description: Test to verify that a grade exactly at 69 returns 'D'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 69.
  Act: Call determinLetter with the grade.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 'D'.
Validation: 
  This scenario is significant as it tests the boundary condition for the 'D' grade category, ensuring accurate grading at pivotal points.
