================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Logical Error in Code Flow
Issue: The code contains a redundant condition where 'numGrade < 60' is checked twice, which can lead to confusion and maintenance issues, potentially causing incorrect behavior in future modifications.
Solution: Remove the redundant conditional check and ensure that each condition is unique and necessary. Review the logic for any other potential overlaps or unnecessary conditions.

Vulnerability: Missing Upper Boundary Check
Issue: The method does not handle cases where 'numGrade' is higher than the highest defined boundary, which could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect outputs for grades higher than 79.
Solution: Implement an additional conditional check to handle 'numGrade' values above 79, ensuring that all possible input values are accounted for and handled appropriately.

Vulnerability: IllegalArgumentException for Negative Input
Issue: Throwing IllegalArgumentException for a negative input is appropriate, but the error message 'Number must be greater than 0' should be 'Number must be non-negative' as zero is a valid grade.
Solution: Modify the error message to accurately reflect the allowed range of input values. Correct the message to 'Number must be non-negative'.

### Test Scenarios for `determinLetter` Method

---

#### Scenario 1: Test with negative grade input
Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeGradeInput  
  Description: This test checks if the method throws an IllegalArgumentException when a negative number is passed as a grade.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Initialize a grade value to a negative number, e.g., -1.  
  Act: Attempt to invoke the `determinLetter` method with the negative grade.  
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.  
Validation:  
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles invalid input by enforcing that grades must be non-negative, as per the method's requirement to throw an exception for negative values.  
  This test is significant as it validates the method's robustness in handling erroneous input that could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect grade categorization.

---

#### Scenario 2: Test with grade less than 60
Details:  
  TestName: testGradeLessThanSixty  
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'F' for grades less than 60.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Initialize a grade value to 59.  
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this grade.  
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 'F'.  
Validation:  
  This assertion confirms that the method correctly categorizes grades below 60 as 'F'.  
  It is crucial for ensuring the method adheres to the grading criteria specified and returns accurate letter grades.

---

#### Scenario 3: Test with grade between 60 and 68
Details:  
  TestName: testGradeBetweenSixtyAndSixtyEight  
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'D' for grades between 60 and 68 inclusive.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Initialize a grade value to 65.  
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this grade.  
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 'D'.  
Validation:  
  This assertion confirms that the method categorizes grades between 60 and 69 correctly as 'D'.  
  Ensuring accurate grade categorization is essential for maintaining the integrity of grading standards.

---

#### Scenario 4: Test with grade between 69 and 79
Details:  
  TestName: testGradeBetweenSixtyNineAndSeventyNine  
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'C' for grades between 69 and 79 inclusive.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Initialize a grade value to 75.  
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this grade.  
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 'C'.  
Validation:  
  This assertion ensures that the method correctly categorizes grades between 69 and 80 as 'C'.  
  This test is significant as it verifies that the grading method adheres to the defined ranges and returns accurate results.

---

#### Scenario 5: Test with grade 80 or higher
Details:  
  TestName: testGradeEightyOrHigher  
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'O' for grades 80 or higher.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Initialize a grade value to 85.  
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this grade.  
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 'O'.  
Validation:  
  This assertion verifies that the method assigns 'O' to grades 80 or higher, which might be intended as a default or exceptional grade category.  
  It is crucial to ensure that the method handles higher grades correctly, though the specific categorization to 'O' should be clarified or corrected according to standard grade letters.

---

These scenarios comprehensively test the `determinLetter` method across various valid and invalid inputs, ensuring that the method behaves as expected under different conditions.
