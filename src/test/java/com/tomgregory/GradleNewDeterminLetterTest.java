================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: undefined
Issue: The method contains redundant conditions which can lead to confusion and potential logical mistakes. Specifically, the condition 'else if (numGrade < 60)' appears twice, which might be a copy-paste error.
Solution: Remove the redundant condition to ensure that the method's logic is clear and maintainable. This will help prevent future errors during maintenance or updates.

### Test Scenarios for the `determinLetter` Method

---

#### Scenario 1: Boundary Test for Low Valid Grade
Details:  
TestName: testDeterminLetterForLowValidGrade  
Description: This test should verify that the method returns 'F' when the minimum passing grade is given (i.e., 0).  
Execution:  
Arrange: None required.  
Act: Call `determinLetter` with 0 as an argument.  
Assert: Assert that the returned value is 'F'.  
Validation:  
This test checks if the grade logic correctly handles edge cases of valid low grades, and helps ensure that students right on the boundary of failing grades receive the correct letter grade. It's important for ensuring fairness in grade evaluations.

---

#### Scenario 2: Negative Grade Handling Test
Details:  
TestName: testDeterminLetterWithNegativeGrade  
Description: Verify that the method throws `IllegalArgumentException` when called with a negative grade.  
Execution:  
Arrange: None required.  
Act: Attempt to call `determinLetter` with a negative value (e.g., -1).  
Assert: Catch and assert the presence of `IllegalArgumentException`.  
Validation:  
This scenario aims to verify that the method correctly handles invalid input (negative grades), which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the grading system and preventing erroneous data entry.

---

#### Scenario 3: Highest Valid 'D' Grade
Details:  
TestName: testDeterminLetterForHighestDGrade  
Description: Verify that the method returns 'D' when the grade is at the upper limit for a 'D' (i.e., 68).  
Execution:  
Arrange: None required.  
Act: Call `determinLetter` with 68 as an argument.  
Assert: Assert that the returned value is 'D'.  
Validation:  
This test ensures that the edge case for a 'D' grade assignment is properly handled, which is important to ensure accurate academic evaluations for students who are borderline between 'D' and 'C'.

---

#### Scenario 4: Exact Threshold for 'C' Grade
Details:  
TestName: testDeterminLetterForLowCGrade  
Description: Test to ensure that a grade of 69 correctly yields a 'C'.  
Execution:  
Arrange: None required.  
Act: Call `determinLetter` with 69.  
Assert: Assert that the returned value is 'C'.  
Validation:  
This test checks the method's correctness at the transition point between 'D' and 'C', which helps enforce grading accuracy and consistency at grade thresholds.

---

#### Scenario 5: Upper Boundary Test for Valid Input
Details:  
TestName: testDeterminLetterForHighGrade  
Description: This test checks if any valid high grade (specifically grades >= 80) returns 'O'.  
Execution:  
Arrange: None required.  
Act: Call `determinLetter` with a grade of 80 or higher (e.g., 100).  
Assert: Assert that the returned value is 'O'.  
Validation:  
This scenario tests if the method correctly handles high grades, ensuring that top-performing students receive the correct acknowledgment in their grading evaluation.

---

These scenarios cover a range of typical, boundary, and error cases that help ensure the robustness and correctness of the `determinLetter` method through rigorous testing of its behavior under various conditions.
