"""
Scenario 1: Testing when a Positive Integer less than 60 is provided

Details:
    TestName: testPositiveIntegerLessThanSixty
    Description: The test is designed to validate whether the method accurately returns 'F' when the provided grade is less than 60. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare the test number grade, such as 50.
    Act: Invoke determinLetter method with the prepared grade.
    Assert: Assert that the returned grade is 'F'.
  Validation: 
    The expected grade is 'F' since any grade less than 60 should yield this result, as per the method code. This is a basic test for grading based on common educational grading standards.

Scenario 2: Testing when a Positive Integer between 60 and 68 is provided

Details:
    TestName: testPositiveIntegerBetweenSixtyAndSixtyEight
    Description: This test checks if the method gives 'D' when the grade is between 60 and 68.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare an integer grade within the range, such as 65.
    Act: Call determinLetter with the prepared grade as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the returned grade is 'D'.
  Validation: 
    Rightfully, the grade should be 'D' as the provided grade belongs in that category as per the method code. It's an important test to ensure the accuracy and fairness of the grading system.

Scenario 3: Testing when a Positive Integer between 69 and 79 is provided

Details:
    TestName: testPositiveIntegerBetweenSixtyNineAndSeventyNine
    Description: This test aims to validate the scenario where if the provided grade is between 69 and 79, the result should be 'C'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a test grade, such as 75.
    Act: Invoke determinLetter with the prepared grade.
    Assert: Assert that the output is 'C'.
  Validation: 
    The test is intended to check the accurate conversion of numerical grades into letter grades according to traditional grading systems. The expected grade is 'C', since the prepared number falls into that category per the code of the method.

Scenario 4: Testing when a Positive Integer more than 79 is provided

Details:
    TestName: testPositiveIntegerGreaterThanSeventyNine
    Description: This test assesses if the method will return 'O' when a grade greater than 79 is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a grade, such as 85.
    Act: Call the determinLetter method with the grade as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the returned character is 'O'.
  Validation: 
    According to the method code, the letter grade should be 'O' for grades above 79.

Scenario 5: Testing when a Negative Integer is provided

Details:
    TestName: testNegativeInteger
    Description: The test checks if the method correctly throws an IllegalArgumentException when a negative grade is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a negative grade, such as -10.
    Act: Call determinLetter with the negative grade.
    Assert: Assert that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    According to the method code, IllegalArgumentException should be thrown for negative grades. This is an important test for error handling and robustness.
