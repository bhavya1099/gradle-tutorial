================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Logical Error in Code Flow
Issue: The code contains a redundant condition where 'numGrade < 60' is checked twice, which can lead to confusion and maintenance issues. This does not directly impact security but can lead to errors in logic that might be exploited in more complex systems.
Solution: Remove the redundant condition to ensure the code is clear and maintainable. Ensure that each condition is unique and necessary.

Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The method accepts an integer input without validating that the input is within a reasonable range for grades. Extremely high values might cause unexpected behavior in systems integrated with this function.
Solution: Implement additional checks to ensure 'numGrade' falls within a realistic range for academic grades, such as 0 to 100.

Vulnerability: Exception Handling
Issue: The method throws a runtime exception (IllegalArgumentException) which must be properly handled by any calling method to prevent application crashes.
Solution: Ensure that any method calling 'determineLetter' is prepared to catch and handle IllegalArgumentException, or consider returning a default value or error code instead of throwing an exception.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with negative grade input

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNegativeGrade
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the determinLetter method when provided with a negative grade. The method should throw an IllegalArgumentException as negative grades are not valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative grade value.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with the negative grade.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles invalid input by throwing an exception. This is crucial to ensure the method does not process or misclassify invalid grade values.

Scenario 2: Test with a grade just below 60

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeJustBelow60
  Description: Tests the determinLetter method with a grade slightly below 60 to ensure it correctly assigns a 'F' grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a grade value of 59.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Check if the returned grade is 'F'.
Validation: 
  The test confirms that the boundary condition at 60 is handled correctly, returning 'F' for grades below this threshold. This is important for accurate grade classification.

Scenario 3: Test with exactly 60 grade

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeExactly60
  Description: Ensures that a grade of exactly 60 is classified correctly according to the grading system implemented by the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a grade value of 60.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with the grade of 60.
  Assert: Verify that the returned letter is not 'F' but the next appropriate grade category.
Validation: 
  This test checks for correct implementation of inclusive boundaries in grade categorization, ensuring that a grade of 60 does not receive an 'F'.

Scenario 4: Test with a grade in the 'D' range

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeInDRange
  Description: Verifies that the determinLetter method assigns a 'D' for grades that fall within the specific 'D' range (60 to 68 inclusive).
Execution:
  Arrange: Input a grade of 65.
  Act: Call determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 'D'.
Validation: 
  This scenario ensures that the method correctly categorizes grades within the 'D' range, which is vital for consistent grading.

Scenario 5: Test with a grade just below 80

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeJustBelow80
  Description: Checks if the method correctly assigns a 'C' for a grade that is just below 80.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a grade of 79.
  Act: Call determinLetter with the grade of 79.
  Assert: Assert that the returned letter is 'C'.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the upper boundary of the 'C' range is handled correctly, ensuring accurate grade classification just below the cutoff.

Scenario 6: Test with a grade above 80

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeAbove80
  Description: Tests if the determinLetter method assigns a grade other than 'C', 'D', or 'F' for grades above 80, which should be considered exceptional or out of ordinary ranges defined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input a grade of 85.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method.
  Assert: Check that the returned letter is not 'C', 'D', or 'F'.
Validation: 
  This test ensures that grades above 80 are recognized distinctly, aligning with grading policies that might treat such high scores with special acknowledgment.
