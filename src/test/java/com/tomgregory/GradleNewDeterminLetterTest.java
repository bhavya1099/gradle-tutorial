### Test Scenarios for the `determinLetter` Method

#### Scenario 1: Test with negative number input
Details:  
  TestName: testWithNegativeInput
  Description: This test checks if the method throws an IllegalArgumentException when a negative number is passed as input. This is important to ensure the method handles invalid inputs correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a negative number as input.
  Act: Call the `determinLetter` method with this negative input.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the method's ability to handle invalid input correctly by throwing an exception. This is crucial for preventing the method from processing invalid grades.

#### Scenario 2: Test with a grade less than 60
Details:  
  TestName: testGradeLessThan60
  Description: Tests if the method returns 'F' for grades less than 60. This test validates the method's ability to correctly assign letter grades according to the grading scale.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an integer grade less than 60.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this grade.
  Assert: Check if the result is 'F'.
Validation:
  This assertion checks the correctness of the 'F' grade assignment for failing scores, which is essential for accurate academic evaluations.

#### Scenario 3: Test with a grade between 60 and 68
Details:  
  TestName: testGradeBetween60And68
  Description: This test ensures that the method returns 'D' for grades between 60 and 68, inclusive of 60 but exclusive of 69.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an integer grade between 60 and 68.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method.
  Assert: Check if the result is 'D'.
Validation:
  The test validates the method's ability to categorize just-passing grades correctly, which is important for distinguishing between different levels of academic achievement.

#### Scenario 4: Test with a grade between 69 and 79
Details:  
  TestName: testGradeBetween69And79
  Description: Checks if the method assigns a 'C' for grades between 69 and 79, inclusive of 69 but exclusive of 80.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a grade in this range.
  Act: Call the `determinLetter` method with this grade.
  Assert: Verify that the returned letter is 'C'.
Validation:
  Asserting a 'C' grade for this range is vital for ensuring proper middle-tier grade assignments, which affects student evaluations and academic records.

#### Scenario 5: Test with a grade 80 or above
Details:  
  TestName: testGrade80OrAbove
  Description: This scenario tests whether the method returns 'O' for grades 80 or above, ensuring that high achievers are recognized appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a grade of 80 or more.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this input.
  Assert: Check if the output is 'O'.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for verifying that the method correctly identifies outstanding academic performance, which is important for honors and distinctions.

#### Scenario 6: Test with exact boundary values
Details:  
  TestName: testBoundaryValues
  Description: Tests the method's response to boundary-grade values like 60, 69, and 79 to ensure accurate letter assignments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Test with multiple boundary values such as 60, 69, and 79.
  Act: Call the `determinLetter` method for each boundary value.
  Assert: Verify that the results are 'D', 'C', and 'C' respectively.
Validation:
  Boundary testing is essential for confirming the grading logic at critical thresholds, ensuring that each grade is categorized correctly without off-by-one errors.
