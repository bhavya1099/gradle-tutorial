================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Logical Error in Condition Checks
Issue: The method contains a redundant condition check for 'numGrade < 60' which can lead to confusion and potential logical errors in future modifications.
Solution: Remove the redundant condition and ensure that all condition checks are unique and necessary.

Vulnerability: Boundary Value Analysis
Issue: The method does not handle the upper boundary condition for 'numGrade', which could lead to unexpected behavior for grades 80 and above.
Solution: Explicitly handle all potential grade ranges, including an upper bound condition to ensure all possible values of 'numGrade' are covered.

Vulnerability: Exception Handling
Issue: The method throws a generic runtime exception for invalid input values, which may not provide sufficient information for debugging or handling by upstream code.
Solution: Use more specific exceptions or create a custom exception class that provides more detailed information about the nature of the error.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with negative grading input

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNegativeInput
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the determinLetter method when provided with a negative grade. The method should throw an IllegalArgumentException as negative grades are not valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative integer value for the grade.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with the negative grade.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should validate that the input grade is non-negative, and throw an exception for invalid input, ensuring data integrity.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates the method's ability to handle incorrect inputs gracefully, which is crucial for maintaining robustness in the grading system.

Scenario 2: Test with a grade just below 60

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeJustBelow60
  Description: This test verifies the method's output when the grade is just below the 'F' threshold (59).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 59.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Assert that the returned grade letter is 'F'.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Checks that the method correctly categorizes a grade of 59 as 'F'.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures accurate grading at boundary conditions which are critical for fair assessments.

Scenario 3: Test with a grade on the boundary of 'D' and 'C'

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeOnBoundaryOfDAndC
  Description: To check if the method correctly assigns a 'D' to a grade of 69, which is the upper limit for a 'D' grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade to 69.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Assert that the returned letter is 'D'.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures that boundary values are handled correctly, assigning the proper letter grade.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Important for ensuring that grading boundaries are respected, which impacts student evaluations.

Scenario 4: Test with a high valid grade

Details:  
  TestName: testWithHighValidGrade
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'O' for high grades that do not fall into other specified categories (e.g., a grade of 90).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade to 90.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Assert that the returned letter is 'O'.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Validates that the method handles grades not explicitly covered by other conditions correctly by defaulting to 'O'.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that students with high grades receive proper recognition, supporting motivational and reward systems in educational settings.

Scenario 5: Test with the lowest possible grade

Details:  
  TestName: testWithLowestPossibleGrade
  Description: This test checks if a grade of 0 correctly results in an 'F'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade to 0.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Assert that the returned letter is 'F'.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures that the method correctly identifies the lowest possible grade as failing.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Critical for correctly identifying failing grades, which can influence academic interventions and support.
