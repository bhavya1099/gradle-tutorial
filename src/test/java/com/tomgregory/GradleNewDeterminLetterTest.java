================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Logical Error in Condition Checks
Issue: The code contains redundant condition checks for 'numGrade < 60', which can lead to unreachable code and incorrect behavior if the code is extended or modified in the future.
Solution: Remove the redundant condition check and ensure that each grade range is covered exactly once. This prevents logical errors and improves code maintainability.

Vulnerability: Exception Handling - IllegalArgumentException
Issue: The use of IllegalArgumentException for a negative input is appropriate, but there might be other scenarios where input validation could be enhanced, such as checking for unrealistic high numbers.
Solution: Extend the input validation to handle other unrealistic input values appropriately, potentially defining an upper limit for 'numGrade' if applicable.

Vulnerability: Hardcoded Values
Issue: The grade boundaries (60, 69, 80) are hardcoded, which makes the system inflexible and harder to maintain should the grading criteria change.
Solution: Refactor the method to accept grade boundaries as parameters or define them as configurable constants or external configuration options. This allows for easier adjustments and testing.

Vulnerability: Missing Default Case in Conditional Logic
Issue: The method lacks a default case for unexpected values that do not fit into defined categories, potentially leading to unhandled outcomes.
Solution: Add a default case in the conditional logic to handle unexpected values gracefully, ensuring that the method always behaves predictably.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with a negative grade input

Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeGradeInput
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the determinLetter method when provided with a negative grade. It should throw an IllegalArgumentException as negative grades are not valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative grade value.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with the negative grade.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles invalid input by throwing an exception, ensuring the method's robustness in face of erroneous data. This is significant as it prevents the method from processing and returning incorrect results for invalid inputs.

Scenario 2: Test with a grade just below 60

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeJustBelow60
  Description: Tests the determinLetter method with a grade of 59 to check if it correctly returns 'F'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade to 59.
  Act: Call determinLetter with this grade.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 'F'.
Validation: 
  This test confirms that the grading boundary condition is handled properly. It is important to ensure accurate grade categorization which directly impacts academic assessments.

Scenario 3: Test with exact boundary of 60

Details:  
  TestName: testBoundaryAt60
  Description: This test verifies if the grade exactly at 60 returns 'D', the next grade category above 'F'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade to 60.
  Act: Call determinLetter with this grade.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 'D'.
Validation: 
  Validating this boundary condition ensures that the method correctly transitions from one grade category to another. It's essential for maintaining precise grade evaluations.

Scenario 4: Test with a grade in the middle of a category (e.g., 75 for 'C')

Details:  
  TestName: testMiddleGradeForC
  Description: Tests the determinLetter method with a grade of 75 to ensure it returns 'C'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade to 75.
  Act: Call determinLetter with this grade.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 'C'.
Validation: 
  This test checks the method's ability to correctly categorize grades within expected ranges. It's crucial for consistent and fair academic grading.

Scenario 5: Test with a grade above top defined boundary

Details:  
  TestName: testAboveTopBoundaryGrade
  Description: Tests the determinLetter method with a grade over 100 (e.g., 105) to see how it handles grades exceeding typical limits.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade to 105.
  Act: Call determinLetter with this grade.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 'O'.
Validation: 
  The test ensures that the method can handle unusually high grades by categorizing them correctly. This can be important in educational systems where extra credit might push grades beyond standard limits.

Scenario 6: Test with grade exactly at 69

Details:  
  TestName: testBoundaryAt69
  Description: Tests whether the determinLetter method returns 'C' for a grade exactly at 69, the boundary between 'D' and 'C'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade to 69.
  Act: Call determinLetter with this grade.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 'C'.
Validation: 
  This test checks the precise handling of boundary conditions, ensuring that the grading system is fair and accurate at critical thresholds.
