================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Logical Error in Condition Checks
Issue: The code contains redundant condition checks for 'numGrade < 60', which can lead to unreachable code and logical errors that may not immediately impact security but can lead to maintenance issues and unexpected behavior.
Solution: Remove the duplicate condition 'else if (numGrade < 60)' and ensure that all intended grade ranges are correctly implemented. Use a consistent and clear conditional structure to prevent logical errors.

Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The method only checks for negative values, assuming all other inputs are valid integers. However, extremely high integer values might cause unexpected behavior or errors in different parts of the application if not handled properly.
Solution: Implement comprehensive input validation to ensure 'numGrade' falls within a realistic and expected range. Consider also handling or logging unexpected high values appropriately.

### Test Scenarios for the `determinLetter` Method

#### Scenario 1: Test with negative grade input
Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeGradeInput  
  Description: This test checks if the method throws an IllegalArgumentException when a negative number is passed as a grade.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Initialize an integer with a negative value.  
  Act: Attempt to invoke `determinLetter` with the negative integer.  
  Assert: Catch the expected IllegalArgumentException and assert that it is thrown.  
Validation:  
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the method correctly identifies and handles invalid negative inputs by throwing an exception.  
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that invalid inputs are properly managed prevents data corruption and promotes robust error handling in the application.

#### Scenario 2: Test with zero as grade input
Details:  
  TestName: testZeroGradeInput  
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'F' when the input grade is zero.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Initialize an integer with value 0.  
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the integer value 0.  
  Assert: Assert that the returned character is 'F'.  
Validation:  
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the method correctly categorizes a grade of 0 as 'F'.  
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: It's crucial for the grading system to accurately classify edge cases like a grade of 0, which represents the lower boundary of the grading scale.

#### Scenario 3: Test with a grade just below 60
Details:  
  TestName: testGradeJustBelow60  
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'F' for a grade of 59.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Initialize an integer with value 59.  
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the integer value 59.  
  Assert: Assert that the returned character is 'F'.  
Validation:  
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures the method correctly assigns 'F' to grades just below the threshold for 'D'.  
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Accurate classification at boundary values is critical for maintaining fairness and consistency in grading.

#### Scenario 4: Test with a grade in the 'D' range
Details:  
  TestName: testGradeInDRange  
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'D' for a grade of 65.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Initialize an integer with value 65.  
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the integer value 65.  
  Assert: Assert that the returned character is 'D'.  
Validation:  
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Confirms that grades within the 60-68 range are correctly classified as 'D'.  
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that the grading system accurately reflects performance within specified ranges.

#### Scenario 5: Test with a grade just below 80
Details:  
  TestName: testGradeJustBelow80  
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'C' for a grade of 79.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Initialize an integer with value 79.  
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the integer value 79.  
  Assert: Assert that the returned character is 'C'.  
Validation:  
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures the method correctly assigns 'C' to grades just below the threshold for a higher grade.  
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Critical for ensuring that the grading boundaries are enforced accurately, affecting student assessments.

#### Scenario 6: Test with a high grade above known ranges
Details:  
  TestName: testHighGradeAboveKnownRanges  
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'O' for a grade of 90.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Initialize an integer with value 90.  
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the integer value 90.  
  Assert: Assert that the returned character is 'O'.  
Validation:  
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Confirms that grades above the highest defined boundary are handled appropriately.  
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures the system is capable of handling exceptional high grades gracefully and consistently.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the method `determinLetter` handles a variety of input cases, correctly interprets grades, and adheres to specified grading criteria, covering both normal and edge cases effectively.
