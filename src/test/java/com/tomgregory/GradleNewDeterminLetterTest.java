================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Logical Error in Condition Checks
Issue: The code contains a redundant condition check for 'numGrade < 60' which leads to unreachable code. This could cause confusion and potential errors in future code modifications.
Solution: Remove the second condition check for 'numGrade < 60'. Ensure each condition is unique and covers all expected ranges correctly.

Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The method lacks complete input validation, specifically it only checks for negative values but not for unreasonably high values which could be used in an abuse case.
Solution: Extend the input validation to check for overly large values that don't make sense in the context, such as grades higher than 100, and handle these cases appropriately.

Vulnerability: Exception Handling
Issue: The method throws a runtime exception for invalid input, which might not be caught if the method is used without proper exception handling, leading to application crashes.
Solution: Use checked exceptions or return a default value/error code that indicates the input was invalid, and document the behavior clearly in the method's API documentation.

### Test Scenarios for the `determinLetter` Method

#### Scenario 1: Test with negative grade input
Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeGradeInput
  Description: This test checks if the method throws an IllegalArgumentException when a negative number is passed as a grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer representing a negative grade, e.g., -1.
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the negative grade.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles invalid inputs by enforcing that grades must be non-negative. It ensures the method's robustness and adherence to specified input constraints.

#### Scenario 2: Test with zero as grade input
Details:  
  TestName: testZeroGradeInput
  Description: This test evaluates the method's response when the input grade is zero, which is a boundary condition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer grade of 0.
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the grade of 0.
  Assert: Assert that the returned letter grade is 'F'.
Validation: 
  This test checks the method's handling of the lowest boundary of grading, ensuring that a grade of zero correctly results in an 'F', aligning with common grading standards.

#### Scenario 3: Test with grade just below passing
Details:  
  TestName: testJustBelowPassingGrade
  Description: This test checks the outcome when the grade is just below the passing mark (59).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer grade of 59.
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the grade of 59.
  Assert: Assert that the returned letter grade is 'F'.
Validation: 
  The test ensures that the method properly categorizes just failing grades as 'F', which is crucial for accurate academic evaluations.

#### Scenario 4: Test with lowest 'D' grade
Details:  
  TestName: testLowestDGrade
  Description: This test checks the method's response to the lowest 'D' grade (60).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer grade of 60.
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the grade of 60.
  Assert: Assert that the returned letter grade is 'D'.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method correctly identifies the threshold for a 'D' grade, which is important for precise grade categorization.

#### Scenario 5: Test with highest 'D' grade
Details:  
  TestName: testHighestDGrade
  Description: This test checks the method's response to the highest 'D' grade (68).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer grade of 68.
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the grade of 68.
  Assert: Assert that the returned letter grade is 'D'.
Validation: 
  This test confirms that the method correctly handles the upper limit for a 'D' grade, ensuring consistent grading within specified ranges.

#### Scenario 6: Test with lowest 'C' grade
Details:  
  TestName: testLowestCGrade
  Description: This test evaluates how the method categorizes the lowest 'C' grade (69).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer grade of 69.
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the grade of 69.
  Assert: Assert that the returned letter grade is 'C'.
Validation: 
  This test checks the accuracy of the method in determining the lower boundary for a 'C' grade, which is essential for correct grade assignments.

#### Scenario 7: Out of expected grade range
Details:  
  TestName: testGradeOutOfRange
  Description: This test checks how the method handles grades that are unexpectedly high, beyond typical grading scales (e.g., above 100).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer grade of 101.
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the grade of 101.
  Assert: Assert that the returned letter grade is 'O'.
Validation: 
  This test ensures that the method can handle outlier values gracefully, returning 'O' for grades not covered by typical grading criteria, which might indicate special cases or errors in grade entry.
