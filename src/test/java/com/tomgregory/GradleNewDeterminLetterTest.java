ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=determinLetter_c927558175

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-480: Use of Incorrect Operator
Issue: In the 'determinLetter' method, the condition 'else if (numGrade < 60)' is repeated twice. This is likely a mistake and may lead to incorrect program behavior.
Solution: Review the logic of the 'determinLetter' method to ensure that all conditions are correct and there are no duplicate or unnecessary conditions.

Vulnerability: CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
Issue: The return value of the 'determinLetter' method is not checked, which can lead to unexpected program behavior if it returns an unexpected value.
Solution: Always check the return value of a method and handle it appropriately, especially if the method can return multiple different values.

Vulnerability: CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard
Issue: The 'determinLetter' method does not handle grades greater than 80. If a grade greater than 80 is passed in, the method will return 'O', which is likely not the intended behavior.
Solution: Ensure that the 'determinLetter' method correctly handles all possible input values. If a grade greater than 80 is passed in, the method should return a letter grade that accurately reflects the grade.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Negative Number Input

Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeNumberInput.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method throws IllegalArgumentException when the input is a negative number. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No need for setup as we are directly passing the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a negative number as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the method throws an exception when a negative number is input. The method is expected to throw an exception since the grade can't be less than 0.

Scenario 2: Test for Grade Less Than 60

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeLessThanSixty.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns 'F' when the input is less than 60.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need for setup as we are directly passing the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a number less than 60 as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to compare the result with 'F'.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the method correctly assigns 'F' to grades less than 60. This is expected as per the grading scheme in the method.

Scenario 3: Test for Grade Between 60 and 69

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeBetweenSixtyAndSixtyNine.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns 'D' when the input is between 60 and 69.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need for setup as we are directly passing the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a number between 60 and 69 as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to compare the result with 'D'.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the method correctly assigns 'D' to grades between 60 and 69. This is expected as per the grading scheme in the method.

Scenario 4: Test for Grade Between 70 and 79

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeBetweenSeventyAndSeventyNine.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns 'C' when the input is between 70 and 79.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need for setup as we are directly passing the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a number between 70 and 79 as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to compare the result with 'C'.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the method correctly assigns 'C' to grades between 70 and 79. This is expected as per the grading scheme in the method.

Scenario 5: Test for Grade 80 and Above

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeEightyAndAbove.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns 'O' when the input is 80 and above.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need for setup as we are directly passing the parameters.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with a number 80 or above as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to compare the result with 'O'.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the method correctly assigns 'O' to grades 80 and above. This is expected as per the grading scheme in the method.
