Scenario 1: Test for numGrade Less Than 0  

Details:  
  TestName: testDeterminLetterForNegativeNumGrade 
  Description: This test is to check the functionality of the determinLetter method when numGrade is less than 0 (i.e., -1). According to the program's logic, it should throw IllegalArgumentException. 
  Execution: 
    Arrange: We will need an integer with a value of -1. 
    Act: Call determinLetter with -1 as the parameter.  
    Assert: Assert that it throws IllegalArgumentException. 
  Validation:  
    The test verifies that when a negative number is passed as an argument, the method throws an IllegalArgumentException. This validates that the method correctly prevents an improper use case. 
  
Scenario 2: Test for numGrade Between 0 and 60 

Details:  
  TestName: testDeterminLetterForFailingNumGrade
  Description: This test is to check the functionality of the determinLetter method when numGrade is between 0 and 60. According to the program's logic, it should return 'F'. 
  Execution: 
    Arrange: We will need an integer with a value, say, 50. 
    Act: Call determinLetter with 50 as the parameter.  
    Assert: Assert that it returns 'F'. 
  Validation: 
    The test verifies that when a number between 0 and 60 is passed as an argument, the method returns 'F'. This validates that the method correctly assigns the appropriate grade for a failing score. 
  
Scenario 3: Test for numGrade Between 60 and 69 

Details:  
  TestName: testDeterminLetterForAverageNumGrade 
  Description: This test is to check the functionality of the determinLetter method when numGrade is between 60 and 69. According to the program's logic, it should return 'D'. 
  Execution: 
    Arrange: We will need an integer with a value, say, 65.  
    Act: Call determinLetter with 65 as the parameter.  
    Assert: Assert that it returns 'D'. 
  Validation:  
    The test verifies that when a number between 60 and 69 is passed as an argument, the method returns 'D'. This validates that the method correctly assigns the appropriate grade for an average score. 

Scenario 4: Test for numGrade Between 69 and 80 

Details:  
  TestName: testDeterminLetterForGoodNumGrade 
  Description: This test is to check the functionality of the determinLetter method when numGrade is between 69 and 80. According to the program's logic, it should return 'C'. 
  Execution: 
    Arrange: We will need an integer with a value, say, 75. 
    Act: Call determinLetter with 75 as the parameter.  
    Assert: Assert that it returns 'C'. 
  Validation: 
    The test verifies that when a number between 69 and 80 is passed as an argument, the method returns 'C'. This validates that the method correctly assigns the appropriate grade for good score. 

Scenario 5: Test for numGrade Greater Than 80 

Details:  
  TestName: testDeterminLetterForExcellentNumGrade 
  Description: This test is to check the functionality of the determinLetter method when numGrade is greater than 80. According to the program's logic, it should return 'O'. 
  Execution: 
    Arrange: We will need an integer with a value, say, 85.  
    Act: Call determinLetter with 85 as the parameter.  
    Assert: Assert that it returns 'O'. 
  Validation:  
    The test verifies that when a number greater than 80 is passed as an argument, the method returns 'O'. This validates that the method correctly assigns the appropriate grade for excellent score.
