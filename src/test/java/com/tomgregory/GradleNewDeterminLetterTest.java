================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-478: Missing Default Case in Switch Statement
Issue: The method 'determineLetter' uses multiple 'if-else' statements to determine the letter grade. However, it lacks a default case or final 'else' statement to handle unexpected values, which might lead to logic errors or unexpected behavior if the method is called with a value above the maximum handled score.
Solution: Add a default clause that handles unexpected inputs gracefully. This can either set a default return value or throw an exception depending on the expected behavior.

Vulnerability: CWE-570: Expression is Always False
Issue: The condition 'numGrade < 60' appears twice in the 'determineLetter' method. The second occurrence is always false because of the prior conditions, meaning it's unreachable code.
Solution: Remove the redundant condition to avoid confusion and potential errors in future code maintenance. Ensure to test all conditions thoroughly to confirm they behave as expected.

Vulnerability: CWE-834: Excessive Iteration
Issue: The method is structured in a way that could be inefficient for checking numerous conditions linearly, which might be considerable if expanded or modified to include more grading criteria.
Solution: Consider refactoring the method to use a switch statement or mapping grades to letters using a sorted data structure, such as a TreeMap, to streamline the lookup process and enhance performance.

Vulnerability: CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
Issue: The method inherently trusts the input without preprocessing or sanity checks beyond the basic condition of being non-negative.
Solution: Implement additional checks or normalization routines to sanitize inputs, ensuring they are within an expected range or format before proceeding with grade determination.

================================================================================
Here are the test scenarios for the method `determinLetter`:

### Scenario 1: Validate Minimum Boundary for F Grade
Details:  
  TestName: validateMinimumBoundaryForFGrade
  Description: Tests if a grade just below the lower limit for a 'F' grade (i.e., 59) returns 'F'.  
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a grade variable set at 59.  
  Act: Call `determinLetter` with the grade variable.  
  Assert: Assert that the result is 'F'.  
Validation: 
  See if the function correctly classifies a grade of 59 as 'F' which is a critical boundary condition to verify grading integrity. It is important for avoiding incorrect grade assignments just below the threshold.

### Scenario 2: Validate Negative Input
Details:  
  TestName: validateNegativeInput
  Description: Ensures the method throws an IllegalArgumentException when passed a negative grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative grade variable, e.g., -1.  
  Act: Attempt to invoke `determinLetter` with this negative grade.  
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.  
Validation: 
  This validates the method's ability to handle incorrect negative inputs, safeguarding against potential bugs or errors in input validation.

### Scenario 3: Validate Edge Case for C Grade
Details:
  TestName: validateEdgeCaseForCGrade
  Description: Test to ensure a grade of 79, which is the upper limit for a 'C' grade, correctly returns 'C'.    
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a grade variable to 79.  
  Act: Call `determinLetter` with the grade.  
  Assert: Check that the result is 'C'.  
Validation: 
  Confirms the upper boundary handling for C grading, which is essential for consistent and fair grading.

### Scenario 4: Incorrect Grade Mapping above 80
Details:  
  TestName: incorrectGradeMappingAbove80
  Description: Ensure grades above 80 do not return 'O' as there appears to be a logical error in the provided mapping method.  
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a grade variable, e.g., 85, which should typically receive an 'A' or 'B' but not 'O'.  
  Act: Call `determinLetter` and store the result.  
  Assert: Verify the result is not 'O'.  
Validation: 
  This test will highlight a suspected bug in the method where grades above 80 are incorrectly classified, which could indicate unhandled cases for typical grades like 'A' or 'B'.

### Scenario 5: Validate Exact 60 Boundary for D Grade
Details:  
  TestName: validateExact60BoundaryForDGrade
  Description: Check that a grade of exactly 60 returns 'D', verifying correct boundary handling.  
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a grade with a value of 60.  
  Act: Call `determinLetter` with this grade.  
  Assert: Assert the result is 'D'.  
Validation: 
  This assures the method appropriately categorizes the exact boundary point for D grading, an important aspect to ensure there's no gap in grading bands.

These scenarios cover a range of typical cases as well as boundary conditions and error handling to ensure the robustness and correctness of the `determinLetter` method.
