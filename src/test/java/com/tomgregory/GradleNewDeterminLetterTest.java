================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Logical Error in Code Flow
Issue: The code contains a redundant condition where 'numGrade < 60' is checked twice, which can lead to confusion and maintenance issues. This does not directly impact security but can lead to logical errors impacting application functionality.
Solution: Remove the redundant condition to ensure the code is clean and maintainable. Ensure all conditions are unique and necessary.

Vulnerability: Boundary Value Analysis
Issue: The method does not handle the upper boundary condition for 'numGrade'. There is no explicit handling for grades between 80 and 100, which might lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect grade assignment.
Solution: Add a condition to handle grades from 80 to 100 explicitly to ensure all possible valid inputs are covered.

Vulnerability: Exception for Invalid Input
Issue: The method throws a generic runtime exception for invalid input (less than 0). This could be handled more gracefully to give clearer error messages or to log such incidents for debugging purposes.
Solution: Consider using a custom exception or a more specific runtime exception to provide more detailed information about the nature of the error. Also, consider logging this exception for audit purposes.

### Test Scenarios for `determinLetter` Method

---

#### Scenario 1: Test with negative number input
Details:  
  TestName: testWithNegativeInput  
  Description: This test checks if the method throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when given a negative integer as an input.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Provide a negative integer as input.  
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` method with the negative integer.  
  Assert: Expect an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown.  
Validation:  
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the method correctly identifies and handles invalid negative inputs by throwing an exception, ensuring the method's robustness against invalid data.  
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures the method's error handling is effective, protecting the application from potential crashes or unexpected behavior due to incorrect inputs.

---

#### Scenario 2: Test with input less than 60
Details:  
  TestName: testInputLessThan60  
  Description: This test verifies that the method returns 'F' for inputs less than 60, which represents a failing grade.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Set the input grade as 59.  
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the value 59.  
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 'F'.  
Validation:  
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures that the method correctly categorizes grades below 60 as 'F'.  
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates the grading logic, confirming that it aligns with the expected academic standards.

---

#### Scenario 3: Test with input between 60 and 68
Details:  
  TestName: testInputBetween60And68  
  Description: This test ensures that the method returns 'D' for grades between 60 and 68 inclusive.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Set the input grade as 65.  
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the value 65.  
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 'D'.  
Validation:  
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Checks the method's ability to correctly assign a 'D' grade to students scoring between 60 and 68.  
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures fair and accurate grade assignments, important for educational assessments.

---

#### Scenario 4: Test with input between 69 and 79
Details:  
  TestName: testInputBetween69And79  
  Description: This test checks if the method assigns a 'C' to grades between 69 and 79 inclusive.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Set the input grade as 75.  
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the value 75.  
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 'C'.  
Validation:  
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures the grading logic correctly places students within this score range into the 'C' grade category.  
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Critical for maintaining grading accuracy and fairness in educational outcomes.

---

#### Scenario 5: Test with input above 79
Details:  
  TestName: testInputAbove79  
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'O' for any input above 79.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Set the input grade as 85.  
  Act: Invoke `determinLetter` with the value 85.  
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 'O'.  
Validation:  
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Validates that the method correctly identifies high achievers and categorizes them as 'O'.  
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that students with high performance are appropriately recognized, which is essential for motivational and record-keeping purposes.
