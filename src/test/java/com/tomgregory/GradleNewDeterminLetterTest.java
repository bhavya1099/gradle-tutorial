Scenario 1: Test with a negative grade value

Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeGradeThrowsException
  Description: This test checks if the method throws an IllegalArgumentException when provided with a negative grade value, as grades cannot be negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an integer for the grade value set to a negative number.
  Act: Attempt to invoke the determinLetter method with this negative grade value.
  Assert: Assert that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the method's error handling for invalid input (negative numbers). This is crucial because grades should logically only be non-negative, and the method must robustly handle incorrect inputs.

Scenario 2: Test with a grade value just below 60

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeBelow60ReturnsF
  Description: This test verifies that the method returns 'F' for a student whose grade is below 60, which falls under the failing category.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 59.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this grade value.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 'F'.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the assertion checks the correct categorization of failing grades. It's significant as it ensures that students are correctly identified as failing if their grades are below 60.

Scenario 3: Test with a grade value at the boundary of 60

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeAt60ReturnsD
  Description: This test checks that the method returns 'D' when the grade is exactly 60, marking the boundary between 'F' and 'D'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 60.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 'D'.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the assertion ensures accurate boundary handling, which is critical for correct grade categorization and fairness in grading.

Scenario 4: Test with a grade value in the middle range for 'C'

Details:  
  TestName: testMiddleCGradeReturnsC
  Description: This test ensures that the method returns 'C' for grades that are squarely in the middle of the 'C' range (70-79).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 75.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 'C'.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks for accurate grade categorization in the 'C' range. It’s significant for maintaining consistent grading standards.

Scenario 5: Test with a grade value just below the upper limit of 80

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeJustBelow80ReturnsC
  Description: This test verifies that the method returns 'C' for a grade of 79, which is just below the cut-off for 'B' (assuming 'B' would be the next logical category).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 79.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 'C'.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the assertion ensures that the method accurately handles upper boundary conditions for a 'C' grade. It’s essential for ensuring fair and precise grading.

Scenario 6: Test with a high grade value

Details:  
  TestName: testHighGradeReturnsO
  Description: This test checks that the method returns 'O' for grades that are 80 or higher, based on the provided method logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the grade value to 85.
  Act: Call the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 'O'.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the method's handling of high grades, ensuring it categorizes exceptionally high achievers correctly, though the exact meaning of 'O' is not defined in the provided method. This is significant for recognizing high performance in grading systems.
