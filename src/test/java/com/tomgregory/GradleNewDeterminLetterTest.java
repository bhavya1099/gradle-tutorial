ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=determinLetter_c927558175

Scenario 1: Test with negative grade input

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNegativeGrade
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the determinLetter method when provided with a negative grade. The method should throw an IllegalArgumentException as negative grades are not valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative grade value.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with the negative grade.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles invalid input by throwing an exception. This is crucial to ensure the method does not process or return a letter grade for an invalid, negative input which could lead to incorrect application behavior.

Scenario 2: Test with a grade that results in 'F'

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeResultingInF
  Description: This test verifies that the determinLetter method returns 'F' for grades less than 60.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a grade value that is less than 60.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 'F'.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that grades under 60 correctly result in a grade letter 'F'. This test is important to confirm that the grading logic correctly categorizes failing grades.

Scenario 3: Test with a grade that results in 'D'

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeResultingInD
  Description: This test verifies that the determinLetter method returns 'D' for grades between 60 and 68 inclusive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a grade value within the range of 60 to 68.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 'D'.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that grades which are poor but not failing are correctly categorized as 'D'. This ensures the grading system accurately reflects performance that is below average but not failing.

Scenario 4: Test with a grade that results in 'C'

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeResultingInC
  Description: This test verifies that the determinLetter method returns 'C' for grades between 69 and 79 inclusive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a grade value within the range of 69 to 79.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 'C'.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that grades which are average are correctly categorized as 'C'. This is significant for correctly identifying average performances in grading evaluations.

Scenario 5: Test with a grade above valid 'C' range

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeAboveValidCRange
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the determinLetter method for grades 80 and above, which seems to have an oversight in the method logic as it does not categorize grades into 'A' or 'B'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a grade value of 80 or more.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this grade.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 'O'.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method currently returns 'O' for grades 80 and above, indicating a potential issue or missing logic in the method as typical grading systems include distinctions for 'A' and 'B' grades. This test highlights the need for further clarification or adjustment in the method's implementation to handle high-performing grades accurately.
