================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Logical Error in Code Flow
Issue: The code contains a redundant condition where 'numGrade < 60' is checked twice, which can lead to confusion and maintenance issues. This does not directly impact security but can lead to logical errors affecting the application's reliability.
Solution: Remove the redundant condition to ensure the code is clear and maintainable. Ensure all conditions are mutually exclusive and cover all possible input ranges appropriately.

Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The method accepts an integer but does not explicitly check for upper boundary conditions or non-integer inputs, which might lead to unexpected behavior if the method is modified to handle different inputs or integrated into a larger system where inputs might vary.
Solution: Implement comprehensive input validation. Check that the input is within a realistic range for grades (e.g., 0-100). Consider throwing an exception if the input is out of expected bounds.

Vulnerability: Exception Handling
Issue: The method throws a generic runtime exception (IllegalArgumentException) which might not be caught or handled specifically, leading to potential disruptions in application flow.
Solution: Use more specific exceptions or create custom exceptions that can inform the caller about the type of error more effectively. Ensure exceptions are caught and handled gracefully where this method is invoked.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with a negative input value

Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeInput
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the determinLetter method when provided with a negative integer. The method should throw an IllegalArgumentException as negative grades are not valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative integer value for numGrade.
  Act: Attempt to invoke the determinLetter method with this negative value.
  Assert: Capture the IllegalArgumentException and verify that it is thrown.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensure that the method correctly identifies and handles invalid negative input by throwing an exception.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates the method's robustness in rejecting invalid inputs, upholding data integrity.

Scenario 2: Test with a grade less than 60

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeBelow60
  Description: Tests whether the determinLetter method returns 'F' for grades less than 60, representing a failing grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an integer value for numGrade below 60.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this value.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 'F'.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should categorize any grade below 60 as 'F'.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures the method accurately assesses failing grades, crucial for academic evaluations.

Scenario 3: Test with a grade between 60 and 68

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeBetween60And68
  Description: Checks if the determinLetter method returns 'D' for grades between 60 and 68, indicating a poor performance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an integer value for numGrade between 60 and 68.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this value.
  Assert: Verify that the returned letter is 'D'.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should categorize grades between 60 and 68 as 'D'.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Confirms the method's capability to correctly evaluate near-failing grades.

Scenario 4: Test with a grade between 69 and 79

Details:  
  TestName: testGradeBetween69And79
  Description: Evaluates if the determinLetter method returns 'C' for grades between 69 and 79, indicative of average performance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an integer value for numGrade between 69 and 79.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this value.
  Assert: Check that the returned letter is 'C'.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should categorize grades between 69 and 79 as 'C'.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Essential for affirming the method's accuracy in assessing mid-range academic performance.

Scenario 5: Test with a grade of 80 or more

Details:  
  TestName: testGrade80OrMore
  Description: Checks if the determinLetter method returns 'O' for grades 80 or above, which seems to be a case of a default return value not matching typical grading systems.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an integer value for numGrade of 80 or more.
  Act: Invoke the determinLetter method with this value.
  Assert: Verify that the returned letter is 'O'.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should categorize grades of 80 or more as 'O', which is unusual and might indicate a need for method review or clarification.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Points out a potential flaw or special rule in the grading logic that may require further investigation.
