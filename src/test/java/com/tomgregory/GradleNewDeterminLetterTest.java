### Test Scenarios for the `determinLetter` Method

#### Scenario 1: Test with negative number input
Details:  
  TestName: testWithNegativeInput
  Description: This test checks if the method throws an IllegalArgumentException when a negative number is passed as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a negative number as input.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with the negative number.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should not accept negative values and must enforce this by throwing an exception.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring the method handles invalid input correctly by enforcing input constraints.

#### Scenario 2: Test with zero as input
Details:  
  TestName: testWithZeroInput
  Description: This test checks the boundary condition where the input is zero, which is the lowest valid grade.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide zero as the input.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with zero.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is 'F'.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should correctly categorize a grade of 0 as 'F'.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates that the method handles boundary conditions accurately.

#### Scenario 3: Test with exact boundary between D and C grades
Details:  
  TestName: testBoundaryBetweenDAndC
  Description: This test checks the correctness of the method at the boundary grade between 'D' and 'C' (68 and 69).
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide inputs of 68 and 69.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with these inputs.
  Assert: Assert that 68 returns 'D' and 69 returns 'C'.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should correctly transition from 'D' to 'C' at the correct grade boundary.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures accurate grade categorization at critical boundaries.

#### Scenario 4: Test with high valid input
Details:  
  TestName: testWithHighInput
  Description: This test verifies the method's response to high valid inputs that should return 'O'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a high grade such as 95.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this input.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is 'O'.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should categorize very high grades as 'O'.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that exceptional performances are recognized correctly.

#### Scenario 5: Test with minimum failing grade
Details:  
  TestName: testWithMinimumFailingGrade
  Description: This test checks the method's response to the minimum failing grade, which is 59.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a grade of 59.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this input.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is 'F'.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should categorize a grade of 59 as 'F'.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates that the method correctly identifies the threshold for failing grades.

#### Scenario 6: Test with repeated incorrect boundary checks
Details:
  TestName: testWithRepeatedIncorrectBoundaryChecks
  Description: This test ensures that the duplicate boundary condition for 'F' (<60) does not interfere with other conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide grades just below and above each grade boundary.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with these grades.
  Assert: Verify that each grade is categorized correctly.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should handle boundary conditions accurately despite the repeated condition in the implementation.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures robustness in grade categorization logic, even when facing potential code redundancies.
