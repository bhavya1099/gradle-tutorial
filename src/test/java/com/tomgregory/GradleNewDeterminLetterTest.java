Certainly! Below are various JUnit test scenarios for the `determinLetter` method provided:

### Scenario 1: Test with a negative grade
Details:
  TestName: testNegativeGrade
  Description: This test verifies that the method throws an IllegalArgumentException when passed a negative grade value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative grade value.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this negative grade.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify the method's handling of invalid input (negative numbers) as per the business rule that grades must be non-negative.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test to ensure the method maintains integrity by not allowing nonsensical grade values.

### Scenario 2: Test with a grade below 60
Details:
  TestName: testGradeBelowSixty
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'F' when a grade less than 60 is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a grade value less than 60.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this grade.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 'F'.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies that the method correctly categorizes grades below 60 as 'F'.
  Elaborate on its importance for correct academic performance evaluation.

### Scenario 3: Test with a grade in the 'D' range
Details:
  TestName: testGradeForD
  Description: This test verifies if the method returns 'D' for grades between 60 and 68 inclusive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a grade value within 60 to 68.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this grade.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 'D'.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks correct categorization of grades in the 'D' range.
  Elaborate on how this ensures accurate academic assessments.

### Scenario 4: Test with a grade in the 'C' range
Details:
  TestName: testGradeForC
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'C' for grades between 69 and 79 inclusive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a grade value within 69 to 79.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this grade.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 'C'.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the method's ability to categorize 'C' grades accurately.
  Discuss its importance in maintaining clear academic standards.

### Scenario 5: Test with a grade of 80 or more
Details:
  TestName: testGradeEightyOrMore
  Description: This test checks if the method returns 'O' for grades 80 or more.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a grade value of 80 or more.
  Act: Invoke the `determinLetter` method with this grade.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 'O'.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify the method correctly handles high grades by returning 'O'.
  Elaborate on the significance of recognizing outstanding performance.

Each of these scenarios ensures that the `determinLetter` method functions correctly across various valid and invalid inputs, adhering to the specified business rules and maintaining the integrity of the grading system.
